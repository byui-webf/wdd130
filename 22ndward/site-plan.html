        Part of personal growth and progress in any sense includes knowing our roots, having our identity current is important, both as members of the church and in the same way the culture of the country from which each one comes. The culture and traditions of each country enrich the human being and allow him to have a broader perspective of himself, it helps to understand ourselves better and to develop a love like that of Jesus Christ. Being certain of our spiritual and earthly origin strengthens us and allows us to cultivate a stronger testimony, likewise as members of an LDS community and neighborhood it is relevant to develop a unity, a more personal contact, not only by attending Sunday services , but also to activities that help us to strengthen bonds of friendship.
The testimonies, experiences, and messages of the leaders, together with the study of the Scriptures themselves, will help us cope with our daily personal challenges and collaborate with the members of the ward to be one in purpose and in faith. This will allow us to have a solid foundation to then effectively exercise our faith through concrete actions, both personally and as a family, and to work for those who have already left this world. Taking action is what will complement the foundation we forged. We hope that the material available on this website can contribute a little to its comprehensive development. We express our gratitude in advance for your collaboration to enrich this site and work together for our well-being.
