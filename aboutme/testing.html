<div> This Christmas, all our local leaders encouraged us to look for opportunities to serve others in our ward,
especially those who might feel lonely for many reasons.</div>
<div> As a ward choir, We have put together a proposal to have a 1-hour visit to three different nursing homes located close to our meetinghouse. <br>
So everyone is invited to participate. Not only through singing but also by participating in the other programmed activities like sharing stories and more! </div>
