    <h2>Juan</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>I'm taking this course because I'm interested in getting certified as a web developer.</p> 
    <p>I'm from Mexico but I currently live in Utah, although I've only lived here for a year and eight months. We are a family of three: my lovely wife, my son and me.</p>
    <p>I like to go out to the places near here to take walks, I also like to listen to music, almost all kind of music, except reggeaton, and watch action and science fiction movies. I love Star Wars saga.</p>
    <p>I would like to learn how to develop web pages to make a page for my wife's business and also be able to consider it later as a source of income.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church since 1995.</p>
    <p>I am excited about taking this course and also to learn from your work.</p>
