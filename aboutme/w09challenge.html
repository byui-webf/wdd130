            <p>Brooklyn Bridge, suspension bridge spanning the East River from Brooklyn to Manhattan in New York City. A brilliant feat of 19th-century engineering, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first bridge to use steel for cable wire, and during its construction explosives were used inside a pneumatic caisson for the first time. Since its construction, the bridge has become an essential landmark of New York Cityâ€”an outstanding architectural accomplishment that is still revered across the world. Accordingly, it has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. National Park Service.</p>
