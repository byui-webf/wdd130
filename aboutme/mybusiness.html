    <h1>My dream business</h1>
    <p>I would like to start a website development and management business. 
        Sites that are creative and easy to use, whose content is of quality and contribute positive things.
        Currently my wife has a business in another country that she needs to attend to and I think that 
        having a website where you can have access to different content that helps the people you work with 
        would be something very useful to boost the business. I believe that just as she requires this tool, 
        there are many people who need someone to help them. That is the type of business that I would like 
        to start, that is why I decided to study these courses. 
    </p>

        I am not sure how long it will take to prepare myself by acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge, 
        but what I am sure of is that it will be worth the effort and time I put into achieving this goal.
