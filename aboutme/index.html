    <h2>Juan Antonio Acatecatl</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! It's a privilege to participate in this course.
        I've seen the bio of all you and it's nice to meet you!!
        Well, I prefer you if call me Antonio besides Juan. My major goes to Applied Technology, I hope 
        to get a first certificate in Web Frontend.
        I am married since 2001, we just have one son, he is 17 years old, he plans serve a mission, so we try 
        to enjoy with him before he leaves. 
        The program of BYU online it's a bless in my life because it gives me the advantage to study at home and save
        money too. 
        My wife have a sale business of essential oils, I think this course will be helpful to improve her business.
        I am LDS since 1995. The Gospel is a bless in my life. I also complete the program of Pathway Connect.
        One of my favorites quotes is of Elder Holland: "No one has failed who keeps trying and keeps praying"
        I think that for sure I'm going to struggle with some things in this course but at the end those things it will help me to grow.</menu>
